## Background
Originally born in Italy and lived in France, Austria, Scotland and China. I have an educational background in Computer Science and Transcultural Communication.

I am currently on the <a href="http://www.twitter.com/TEDxVienna" target="_blank">TEDxVienna</a> and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/VRVienna" target="_blank">VRVienna</a> social media teams and have experience independently managing the <a href="http://www.twitter.com/GamesAustria" target="_blank">Games Austria</a> and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/CEGConf" target="_blank">Central European Games Conference (CEGC)</a> channels. In addition, I give advice to various organisations on their social media strategy and can often be found livetweeting at conferences, either through my <a href="http://www.twitter.com/meowstations" target="_blank">personal channels</a> or the official conference channels.

During my time at university, I learned to hone my copywriting and translation skills in English, German and Spanish, complementing this knowledge by taking on projects as a freelance translator - focusing on Italian and English.

Having recently completed a one year internship at the <a href="http://www.iaea.org" target="_blank">International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)</a>, I have acquired further experience in translation, proofreading, editing and quality assurance. My main working languages during that period were Spanish and English.
