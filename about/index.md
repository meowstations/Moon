## Background
Originally born in Italy and lived in France, Austria, Scotland and China. I have an educational background in Computer Science and Transcultural Communication.

I am currently on the TEDxVienna and VRVienna social media teams and have experience independently managing the <a href="http://www.twitter.com/GamesAustria">Games Austria</a> and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/CEGConf">Central European Games Conference (CEGC)</a> channels. In addition, I give advice to various organisations on their social media strategy and can often be found livetweeting at conferences, either through my personal channels or the official conference channels.

Having recently completed a one year internship at the <a href="http://www.iaea.org">International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)</a>, I have acquired further experience in translation, proofreading, editing and quality assurance.
